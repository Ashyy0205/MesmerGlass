"""Deprecated entry point.

Historically ``python run.py`` launched the GUI and exposed a few ad-hoc
subcommands (server, test). The canonical interface is now the argparse CLI
exposed via ``python -m mesmerglass``. This file remains as a *shim* so
external docs / scripts do not break immediately. It will be removed in a
future minor release.
